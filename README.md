Overview
========

I designed and implemented an eCommerce website in the second semester. Following are the functions and features of this eCommerce website.

1.  This web solution I developed is an eCommerce website selling electronic products, using ground-zero PHP code and vanilla JavaScript. No framework is used for faster and easier website development in this project.
2.  It has a dynamic carousel feature that showcases the products in a stylish manner to provide a better user experience.
3.  Users can filter the products by category and sort them by price or name for easier navigation.
4.  Detailed specifications of the selected products are displayed when they are clicked.
5.  The shopping cart feature allows users to add products and calculates the total cost, including shipping detail.
6.  Shipping information such as name and email address is collected and recorded for order processing.
7.  All orders and transactions are stored in a table for efficient tracking and management.
8.  The web solution is designed to be mobile-friendly, providing a seamless browsing experience on smartphones.
9.  It was developed from scratch without using pre-made templates, resulting in a customized and unique design.
10.  Overall, this user-friendly web solution offers efficient online shopping for electronic products.
